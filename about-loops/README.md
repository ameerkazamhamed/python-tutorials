Here we use the terms *counter* loop instead of *for* loop though they
are the same but with greatly different syntax. This is keep the language
consistent with code.org.

In the same way we use *repeat* to describe Python's *while* loop. There
is no *do until* in Python because it can so easily be implemented with
*while* as well.
