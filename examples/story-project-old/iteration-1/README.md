This iteration is meant to ease students into complicated code by
deliberately using only the simple single-file programming techniques
learned up to this point. It serves as an example or not necessarily
bad code, but what can happen without migrating a project to a more
robust (less brittle) coding paradigm.

This first iteration doesn't even use functions creating an immediate
problem for the student (and a motivation to find a solution,
which we introduce first by adding functions here). In fact, only
basic understanding of basic data types, `print()`, `input()`,
`if/elif/else`,`format()` are needed.

This lesson is key in shifting student thinking to solution design
over just-make-it-work approaches as they get more exposure to what
it takes to build enterprise-worthy larger applications.
