tkinter.Canvas
==============

While most documentation you'll read will deal mostly with the other
`tkinter` components, `tkinter.Canvas` is one of the most fun for
beginners to play around with and serves as the engine underneath the
Python [`turtle`](http://github.com/skilstak/python-tutorials/turtle/)
module.

We are also using it to build out a light-weight
[`tkgm`](http://github.com/skilstak/tkgm) game engine.
