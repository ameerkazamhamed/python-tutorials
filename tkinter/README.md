tkinter/tkk
===========

Bunch of snippets illustrating different components of the standard
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.html) and the
standard [tkk](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.ttk.html)
extension, (which is bundled with tkinter since 2.6 or so.)

**Always use the `tkk` versions of components when they are available.**

Also see the [revised Bubble Blaster
project](https://github.com/skilstak/dk-help-your-kids-with-computer-coding/blob/master/bubble-blaster/revised-oop.py)
for one way to incorporate tkinter/tkk into your object-oriented games
and other projects.
