A place to organize live and prepared class materials. Stop in often to
find new stuff.

The general approach is to learn fundamentals in the following order:

1. [Actions (Function Calls)](actions)
1. [Variables](variables) 
1. [Strings](strings)
1. [Numbers](numbers)
1. [Operators (Assignment, Basic Math)](operators)
1. [Logic (Booleans and Conditionals)](conditionals)
1. [Loops](loops)
1. [Lists-Tuples](lists-tuples)
1. [Dictionaries](dictionaries)
1. [Procedures (Function Definitions - No Return Value)](procedures)
1. [Functions (Function Definitions - Return Value)](functions)
1. [Classes](classes)
1. [Objects](objects)
1. [Modules](modules)
1. [Importing](importing)
1. [Exceptions](exceptions)
1. [Files](files)
1. [Packages](packages)
1. [JSON-YAML](json)
1. [Testing](testing)

Beyond the basics:

1. [Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)](lambdas)
1. [List Mapping and Comprehensions](comprehensions)

Then there are the types of programs:

1. [Commands](commands)
1. [Interactive-REPL](interactive-repl)
1. [GUI-2D-turtle](turtle)
1. [GUI-2D-tkinter](tkinter)
1. [GUI-2D-kivy](kivy)
1. [GUI-2D-pygame](pygame)
1. [GUI-2D-splat](splat)
1. [GUI-3D-panda3d](panda3d)
1. [GUI-3D-sdl2](sdl2)

FAQ
===

**Why no event programming, asyncio, and callbacks?**

We save those topics when learning JavaScript even though Python
clearly has them as well.

**Why no Flash or Pyramid or Django or anything web related?**

JavaScript is the second main language everyone learns at SkilStak. The
natural point to begin is with web technology. While Python certainly has
good stuff for creating web technology, and has a huge following with
real deployments to it's name, at SkilStak we've decided to focus on
JavaScript/Node for anything web related, (single-page-apps, web sites,
REST APIs, etc.) rather than spend time learning how to do the same
things in Python. This decision is more about exposure to JavaScript
and its different paradigm (functional, prototypal, asynchronous) than
it is about which language is better or more popular for such things.

However, Python *is* first and foremost a backend, platform language
chosen over and over again by developers, architects, creatives, and
scientists for producing games, apps and systems of all sizes and for
embedding into other applications (i.e. Blender, Gimp, etc.) This is
Python's greatest strength and the place you will likely most encounter
Python in the working world.
