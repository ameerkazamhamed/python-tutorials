A place to organize live and prepared class materials. Stop in often to
find new stuff.

The general approach is to learn fundamentals in the following order:

1. Actions (Function Calls)
1. Variables 
1. Math
1. Conditionals
1. Loops
1. Functions (Function Definitions)
1. Classes
1. Modules
1. Packages

Note
====
We use the language and terms from [code.org](http://learn.code.org) for
consistency (e.g. 'counter loops' instead of 'for loops')
